## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Introduction
The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card datasets. The dataset used contains highly imbalanced data, so various techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, and feature engineering have been applied to improve model performance.

### Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use of machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve

### Dataset
- The dataset is taken from Kaggleâ€™s [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
- Contains 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent (highly imbalanced).

## Iris Flower Classification

### Introduction
The **Iris Flower Classification** project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project demonstrates a simple classification problem using popular machine learning algorithms.

### Features
- Data visualization and exploration
- Model training using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees
- Cross-validation to improve model accuracy
- Confusion matrix and accuracy score for model evaluation

### Dataset
- The dataset used is the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), consisting of 150 samples and 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## Sales Prediction Using Python

### Introduction
The **Sales Prediction** project aims to predict future sales based on historical sales data. It uses time series analysis and regression algorithms to forecast sales figures.

### Features
- Time series data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with data visualization
- Regression models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees for prediction
- Evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### Dataset
- This dataset contains historical sales data for retail stores. The dataset can be found on Kaggle or other open data sources.
